Project Summary
Our project is a crosswalk assistant that helps blind people cross the street. The main part of the project detects when a car is coming and tells the pedestrian to stop and that there is danger.

Goals and Objectives
The main goal of the project is to make crossing the street safer for blind or visually impaired.

GPIO
The GPIO is used to show a light to the oncoming cars that a pedestrian is planning to cross the street. 

GUI
The GUI is a live feed of the camera and it is also a counter of how many people are in the camera view and how many cars are in the cameras view.
